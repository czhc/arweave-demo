# Arweave Demo

#### Notes

- pay-once-forever storage model
	+ costs paid goes into endowment to pay for future storage costs based on interest earned
	+ _theoretically possible_ as cost of storage decreases over time
	+ even if storage costs remain as the are, _one-time storage fee can cover cost of storage over 200 years_
	+ est USD 0.01 for 4-6 MB of data. 
- _permanent_ data storage / _permaweb_
	+ Use cases: 
		* Storage for other blockchains
		* Legal documents
		* Govt data: land titles, official records
		* Academic papers and research
- only needs to verify a random, previous block instead of the whole chain i.e. block _weave_ vs _chain_
- Applications on Arweave: 
	+ ArDrive: file sharing app
	+ ArGo: website hosting
	+ Pianity: music sharing / NFT
	+ Redstone: customizable defi data sets (?)
	+ Glass.xyz : Video/livestreaming. nice UI, content is meh. 
- vs IPFS
	+ requires "pinnning" 
		* Pinata: must be accessed within 6 months. 
	+ IPFS data is stored _at no cost_ **as long as Protocol Labs continues to offe free storage**, **reserves the right to terminate NFT storage**
